# Classification of pets using Convolution Neural Networks!


## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized to form a meaningful dataset.
- Used binary classification for Dog and Cat images.
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries.

### Did data Preprocessing.
### Did Data Augmentation.


# And then I made a Model for the Prediction :
## Used Convolution Neural Networks - CNN

# Created this model:
- Added CNN layer
- Max pooling
- Added second layer
- Flattening
- Added Dense Layer

## And then for the last layer,
- Used Support Vector Machine - SVM
- Since, it is a binary classification, so i used Linear SVM.

### Initialized the Model <br> and Trained it.
- by trsining for 20 epoches.


## Plotted the Prediction.
### Accuracy -

### And Loss -

Finded the best parameters.
Saved the model to pickle.
